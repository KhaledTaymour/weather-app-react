# Weather App React

This is a Weather App project made using react and fetching its data from openweathermap.

---
## Technical Aspects

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with the typescript template.

### Git Commit Message Style

Used the [Udacity Git Commit Message Style Guide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

e.g.:

> feat: Install Sass.

### File Structure

#### Styles:

- SASS was used.
- [ITCSS](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/inverted-triangle-css-web-development/), which is an organizational method for writing reusable and scalable CSS, was chosen for dividing sass files into `partials`. [see a real example](https://www.carloscaballero.io/understanding-itcss-real-case-using-itcss-https-carloscaballero-io/).
